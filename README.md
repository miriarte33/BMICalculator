# BMICalculator is a simple command line program I created using c++ and the XCode IDE. 
Hopefully, eventually the program will be able to handle the users age and activity level to factor their BMI. 
As of right now, the only factors are height and weight.
In order to view and/or edit, click BMICalculator and then BMI.cpp.
